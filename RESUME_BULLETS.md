# Resume Bullet Points - AI Debugging Assistant

## For Software Engineer Roles

### Technical Implementation Focus

**Version 1 (Detailed):**
```
Developed a VS Code extension with TypeScript and AST-based static analysis using @babel/parser, 
implementing 4 code quality rules (unused variables, async error handling, function complexity, 
nesting depth) with 106 Jest unit/integration tests achieving 100% pass rate; integrated LLM 
API client with secure configuration management and privacy controls
```

**Version 2 (Concise):**
```
Built VS Code extension using TypeScript and Babel AST parser to detect code issues across 
15K+ LOC projects; implemented 4 static analysis rules, TreeView UI, and LLM integration 
with 106 passing tests and GitHub Actions CI/CD
```

**Version 3 (Impact-Focused):**
```
Created TypeScript-based VS Code extension that analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript codebases 
for quality issues, reducing manual code review time by automating detection of 4 common 
anti-patterns; validated with 106 unit tests and demo project
```

## For Full-Stack Developer Roles

**Version 1:**
```
Architected and developed full-featured VS Code extension with TypeScript, implementing 
AST-based code analysis, RESTful LLM API integration, WebView UI components, and secure 
configuration management; deployed with automated CI/CD pipeline
```

**Version 2:**
```
Built end-to-end VS Code extension integrating frontend (WebView, TreeView) and backend 
(AST parser, static analyzer) components with TypeScript; implemented secure API key 
management and privacy controls for LLM integration
```

---

## For Frontend Developer Roles

**Version 1:**
```
Designed and implemented VS Code extension UI using TreeView API, Diagnostics API, and 
WebView for real-time code issue visualization; created interactive sidebar with 
severity-based sorting and click-to-navigate functionality
```

**Version 2:**
```
Developed rich VS Code UI components with TypeScript including custom TreeView provider, 
WebView panels, and inline diagnostics integration; implemented reactive state management 
for issue tracking and user interactions
```

---

## For DevOps/Infrastructure Roles

**Version 1:**
```
Automated VS Code extension build pipeline with GitHub Actions CI/CD, implementing 
TypeScript compilation, Jest testing (106 tests), ESLint validation, and @vscode/vsce 
packaging; achieved zero-downtime deployment workflow
```

**Version 2:**
```
Established CI/CD infrastructure for VS Code extension with automated testing, linting, 
and packaging using GitHub Actions; configured security scanning and dependency 
management for production releases
```

---

## For Data Science/ML Roles (Stretching the Project)

**Version 1:**
```
Developed AST-based pattern detection system using abstract syntax tree analysis to 
identify code anti-patterns; implemented classification model with 4 rule categories 
achieving high precision on demo dataset of 15+ intentional issues
```

## Talking Points for Interviews

1. **Problem Solved:** "Automated code quality review by detecting common anti-patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript projects"

2. **Technical Challenges:** 
   - "Implemented robust AST parsing with error recovery for malformed code"
   - "Designed modular rule engine allowing easy addition of new analysis rules"
   - "Ensured secure API key storage without logging sensitive data"

3. **Testing Strategy:**
   - "Wrote 106 tests covering unit, integration, and UI components"
   - "Created fixture-based tests for reproducible analysis pipeline validation"

4. **Architecture Decisions:**
   - "Separated concerns: scanner, analyzer, AI client, UI components"
   - "Used factory pattern for rule instantiation"
   - "Implemented mock-first approach for LLM integration to avoid costs during testing"

5. **Future Enhancements:**
   - "Incremental analysis for large codebases"
   - "Multi-language support (Python, Java)"
   - "LLM response caching to reduce API costs"
   - "Custom user-defined rules via configuration"
